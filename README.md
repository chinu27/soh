# soh 

SoH was the name of the first clan i ever played multiplayer games with.
They were a bunch of really people i had the pleasure to meet and play with.


 Various Functionalities-
1. Discord and Teamspeak servers of various clans.
2. Leaders can recruit new members for their clans.
3. See the recent games trending and clan info.
4. Meet like minded gamers and play together.


So, this project is dedicated to them its just a site to get into and talk/add people,yep pretty simple made using laravel,php and node.js.

"GGs for all our games together mates."

will add more functionality later(hopefully).
